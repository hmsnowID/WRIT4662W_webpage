# WRIT4662W_webpage
Repository for Fall semester 2018 WRIT4662W webpage creation project
This is my brief self-introduction: My name is Heather Snow, and I am a writer learning how to apply my writing skills in the field of technical communication and instruction design-- specifically, in this case, in digital technology. I have dabbled in web design and coding previous to this, but a few years have elapsed since then. This is my first experience with GitHub. So far, so good!
